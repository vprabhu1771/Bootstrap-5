Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert inline. Here’s how:

    Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.

    Add a close button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the close button.

    On the close button, add the data-bs-dismiss="alert" attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. 
    Be sure to use the <button> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.

    To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade and .show classes.

You can see this in action with a live demo:


<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">

  <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields below.

  <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>

</div>


When an alert is dismissed, the element is completely removed from the page structure. 

If a keyboard user dismisses the alert using the close button, their focus will suddenly be lost and, 

depending on the browser, reset to the start of the page/document. 


For this reason, we recommend including additional JavaScript that listens for the closed.bs.alert event 
and programmatically sets focus() to the most appropriate location in the page. 

If you’re planning to move focus to a non-interactive element that normally does not receive focus, 
make sure to add tabindex="-1" to the element.
